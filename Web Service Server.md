# Program 2: Generate a Web Client from an available public WSDL Code

## Prerequisites

Similar to last program, make sure you have Eclipse installed on your machine with a working TomCat Server Implementation

Note: Here we use local WSDL file from previous program.

## Steps

- Open Eclipse J2E and go to File -> Web Services -> Web Service Client.

- Now Click on Browse and type the wsdl url in the box (select previous wsdl file).

- Finish the wizard, now you will see the same output as previous program since we are using the same wsdl file.

- Give input and invoke the method.

- Results will be displayed in the bottom Results tab.
